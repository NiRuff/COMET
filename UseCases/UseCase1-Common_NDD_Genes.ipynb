    "What we can see here, is that all of our more detaileld communities, somehow contribute to the significance of the general term 'Disease' when analyzing the gene list as one large input. This actually represents a prime example of how results that are related to a variety of underlying processes, can to a large extent contribute to unspecific top-level terms. While e.g. the genes found in community 2 do mainly contribute to terms related to Cell Cycle and mitotic regulation, they also partially contribute to the significance of the term 'Disease'. As the is true also for the other communities we find here, this more unspecific term gains more significance the more diverse biological processes are actually part of the results. This is why our community detection helped here to put more emphasize on the individual results hidden within this complex list of genes!"
