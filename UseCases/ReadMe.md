**Human, gene lists only!**

This notebook explores the analysis of gene lists identified at the intersection of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). It highlights how community detection with BioComet can enrich our understanding of biologically relevant processes in neurodegeneration, providing insights into common genetic underpinnings across different conditions.

### üï∞Ô∏è UseCase2-Circadian_Rhythm_Pathways_in_NDDs.ipynb

**Human, gene lists and corresponding regulation!**

Focusing on specific pathways, particularly the circadian rhythm, within four NDDs, this notebook demonstrates the advanced visualization features of BioComet. It delves into the analysis and interpretation of KEGG pathway analyses, showcasing the tool's capability to elucidate regulatory mechanisms and their disruptions in disease contexts.

### üê≠ UseCase3-Mouse_Transcriptomic_Data_Analysis.ipynb

**Mouse, gene lists and corresponding regulation!**

The third use case extends BioComet's application beyond human data, applying it to mouse transcriptomic data. This notebook illustrates how BioComet can be leveraged to analyze data from non-human organisms, providing a comprehensive example of its use in a broader range of biological research scenarios.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with these use cases, simply navigate to the desired notebook file and open it in a Jupyter environment. Each notebook contains detailed instructions and code snippets to guide you through the analysis process, ensuring a smooth and informative experience with BioComet.
